The growth of data-driven decision makers is noticeable in our society.
Although these models provide a variety of advantages, they're responsible for causing a phenomenon known as algorithm discrimination.
Due to their immense popularity, the discrimination caused by such decision makers ended up becoming a serious problem, and it has to be prevented and countered.
This project describes a mathematical and computational approach of the main solutions and techniques to detect and correct discrimination in datasets.
